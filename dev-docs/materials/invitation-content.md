## What is COhere?

COhere invites all of us into the process of cultivating a more connected home and holding greater responsibility for the health of our wider community and ecology.

### Our Three-Phase Blueprint

**1. Invitation** (September 24, 2025)
For those who feel the call to contribute in a more direct way to weaving a more resilient local community, we invite you to gather with us and co-create what COhere can be. This is an invitation to reflect on events you may wish to steward or other processes or systems you might like to bring forward within the context of COhere.

**2. Invocation** (October 16, 2025)
We come together as a whole community to speak, to listen, to dance, to sing, to celebrate and to envision. We invoke the spirit of COhere, calling forward a spirit of togetherness and a more beautiful vision for our home.

**3. Integration** (October 26, 2025)
We gather to explore what has unfolded, reflect on who we are as a community, and touch into the question of what now feels possible. We deepen our bonds and form commitments to each other and to the wider world.
