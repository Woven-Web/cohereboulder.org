# The Spirit of COhere

## What is the Spirit of COhere?

The spirit of COhere is the living essence that animates our community weaving work. It's not just a set of principles or values, but a felt sense of interconnection, possibility, and collective care that emerges when we gather with intention.

The spirit of COhere is invoked when we:
- Step out of isolation and into connection
- Move from scarcity thinking to collective abundance
- Shift from individual achievement to community thriving
- Transform competition into collaboration
- Turn strangers into neighbors, and neighbors into family

## How We've Come to Know It

Through our first cycle in 2024 and continued community engagement, we've discovered that the spirit of COhere manifests as:

### A Feeling
- The warmth of genuine welcome
- The excitement of discovering unexpected connections
- The relief of finding your people
- The joy of co-creating something beautiful together
- The peace that comes from knowing you're held by community

### A Practice
- Showing up with open hearts and curious minds
- Offering our gifts generously
- Receiving support gracefully
- Celebrating each other's successes
- Holding space for all emotions - grief, joy, fear, hope

### A Commitment
- To the long-term health of our community
- To regenerative practices that heal our relationships with each other and the land
- To justice, equity, and inclusion
- To the generations that come after us
- To the web of life that sustains us all

## Our Living Values

These values emerged from our community and continue to evolve:

### 1. Active Participation
**"This game, much like life, becomes more fun when we are all leaning in."**

The spirit of COhere invites us to move from passive consumption to active co-creation. Every person's participation matters and shapes what emerges.

### 2. Care for the Collective
**"Let's nurture our collective well-being, ensuring that everyone feels held, valued, and seen."**

We tend to the health of the whole, knowing that individual thriving and collective thriving are inseparable.

### 3. Radical Interdependence
**"Be bold with offers and requests. Let's find out what's possible when we lean on one another."**

We acknowledge our fundamental interconnection and practice asking for help and offering support as sacred acts.

### 4. From the Roots Come the Fruits
**"We are capable of great things! But let's focus on foundational relationships and shared context over outputs."**

We trust that when we tend to relationships and build trust, beautiful projects and collaborations naturally emerge.

### 5. Anchor Abundance
**"Collectively, we are so resourced. Give generously, and trust that the rising tide will lift all ships."**

We practice abundance mindset, knowing that when we share freely, there is enough for everyone.

### 6. Amplify What's Good
**"Celebrate and amplify the aspects of individuals, this place, and this community we love."**

We choose to focus on and strengthen what's working, while compassionately tending to what needs healing.

## Words from the Community

*"COhere taught me that community isn't something you find - it's something you create, together, every day."*

*"The spirit of COhere is like mycelium - mostly invisible but connecting everything, sharing nutrients, communicating across the whole forest floor."*

*"I came expecting an event. I left understanding it as a way of being."*

*"COhere reminded me that we don't have to wait for permission to start weaving our community stronger. We can begin right now, right where we are."*

## Carrying It Forward

The spirit of COhere is not owned by any organization or group. It belongs to all of us and grows stronger each time we:

- Choose connection over isolation
- Practice generosity over scarcity
- Celebrate diversity over conformity
- Build bridges over walls
- Create together over competing alone

This spirit is ancient and new, local and universal. It's the spirit of communities throughout time who have known that our survival and thriving depend on each other.

In Boulder, we're remembering and reimagining what this looks like for our time, our place, our people. And we invite you to help us discover what else is possible when we invoke and embody the spirit of COhere.

*"The journey of weaving our resilience never begins and never ends. COhere is simply a blueprint to call deeper attention to this process in which we all engage."*
