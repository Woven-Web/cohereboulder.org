## Design Decisions

### Visual Language
- Maintained earth/nature/community color palette
- Added phase-specific colors (teal, orange, green)
- Used cards for better content organization
- Implemented hover effects and transitions

### Content Strategy
- Shifted from event to process messaging
- Emphasized year-round engagement
- Made participation pathways clearer
- Preserved historical context

### Technical Approach
- Created modular, reusable components
- Maintained TypeScript type safety
- Used existing shadcn/ui components
- Prepared for future data integration

## Known Issues & TODOs

1. **Calendar Page** - Still needs Google Calendar integration
2. **Forms** - Currently placeholder buttons, need actual form embeds
3. **External Links** - Kumu map, payment links need implementation
4. **Mobile Testing** - Should verify all new pages on mobile
5. **Content Review** - Final copy editing needed
6. **SEO** - Meta tags and descriptions need updating

## Deployment Considerations

Before deploying to production:
1. Replace homepage route (swap Index and IndexNew)
2. Update environment variables for forms
3. Test all navigation paths
4. Verify mobile responsiveness
5. Set up analytics tracking
6. Configure email service integration

This implementation provides a solid foundation for COhere's evolution from a one-time event to an ongoing community weaving process. The modular architecture allows for easy updates and expansions as the vision continues to evolve.
